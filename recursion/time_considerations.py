Time considerations (time complexity) of recursion
How to avoid repeating yourself (ex.: Fibonacci numbers)?

Memoization & caching:
- important technique for optimizing recursive algorithms - caching previously calculated results to avoid duplication
of work (e.g. we've computed some expensive operation and we won't have to recompute it again in subsequent recursive calls).
